									<h2>Assignments and Projects Reflection</h2>
									<p>I have learned how to seamlessly integrate front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to 
										create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces. Moreover, delving into back-end development 
										with PHP and SQL has opened my eyes to the intricacies of server-side programming and database management. This holistic approach has provided me with a well-rounded understanding of full-stack web development.

										One of the most striking realizations was how a well-thought-out design can significantly enhance the 
										user experience. By experimenting with different layouts, color schemes, and interactive features, I 
										have come to appreciate the balance between aesthetics and functionality.
										
										Reflecting on this journey, I am proud of the progress I have made and excited about the future 
										possibilities. Each project has been a learning opportunity, pushing me to think creatively and 
										solve problems effectively. The skills and knowledge I have acquired this semester will undoubtedly 
										serve as a strong foundation as I continue to pursue my passion for web development.
										
										Overall, this semester has not only honed my technical abilities but also ignited a deeper a
										ppreciation for the art of creating engaging and dynamic websites. I look forward to applying 
										these skills in future projects and continuing to explore the ever-evolving world of web development.</p>

										<h2>My suggestion</h2>
										<p>As for my suggestion, i would like my future groupmates to be more open when it comes with discussion.
										</p>
									</header>
									<p>Other projects are fine since, most of the time my teammates are very friendly and very open on giving opinion, but when it times to start
										the discussion and brainstorming, that took a toll on our time since most of my teammates are always busy with other stuff.
